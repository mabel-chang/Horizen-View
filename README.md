    Display/Solve:
        The project was designed to display a simple to read interface that lets the user click through the astrological times of day. Specifically, the time of sunrise, sunset, noon, and when civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight begin and end. These times are for the specific location provided by the user in coordinates as well as on the opposite side of the world of the imported coordinates.
